Week 2 Quiz (Click to start quiz)
This is a 17 question quiz based on this week's topic.  It is open book, open notes, and you may take it as many times as necessary to achieve a perfect score. 


The quizzes are a "participation grade," which means that you can retake them as many times as necessary. However, please be aware that low scores are a sign that you need to go back to the reading assignment, slow down, and read more carefully. Many of the answers to this quiz are more general in nature and may not be found in this week's chapters, so you may have to do some extra research for the answers.

You need to take the quiz by the end of the week to earn credit.

This quiz is worth 20 points.

Read all postings and respond, following the guidelines for participation. This part of the discussion assignment is due by the end of the academic week to get credit.

Discussion forums are graded weekly following the academic week. You receive up to 30 total points: 15 points for an original posting and up to 15 additional points for your replies. Check the Posting Guidelines below to see how you can get full credit for participation. Look for the grades to appear in the online grade book following your academic week.




General Posting Guidelines (for participation):  This assignment requires an Original Posting from you of 2-3 paragraphs answering one of the weekly questions provided by your professor. Your original post should be completed and posted in Blackboard by Friday so others have an opportunity to read and respond to your original post.  Refrain from attaching your post via a Word document.  A minimum of three replies for adequate credit must be made by Sunday.

To start your original post, create a new thread with the title that includes the assignment name and your name.  (For example – “Week 1 - Mary Smith”) That way, everyone knows to whom they are responding.  In addition to your original post that should be posted by Friday, you must respond to other original posts made by your classmates to get credit for discussion.  A minimum of three responses that demonstrate critical thinking is required to receive minimum credit (80%) for participation (a 'B-' grade).  More participation means more credit. Reply messages with no content toward discussion such as "Good post." or "I agree" postings do not count. Please use Standard English with proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling in your postings. Also, your reply messages must be posted on more than one day – you shouldn’t plan to do everything on one day, and for sure not on the last day of the academic week. Don't wait until the last minute!
