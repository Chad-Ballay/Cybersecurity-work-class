## Important Notes
* Our academic week officially begins on Monday morning.

* Course Schedule found under "My Syllabus."

* Each week, you participate in discussions. You must post at least five messages to get full credit for this assignment. The first message is your original posting, which should be posted by Friday night at the very latest so that other students have a chance to read and respond. The other messages, two of which should be responses to other student original postings, posted on different days, must be posted by Sunday evening at the very latest.

* You will receive your grades for each week before the next week begins.

* Microsoft Word is the required file format for homework and any submittals for papers.

  *  All text has been spellchecked and checked for grammar.

  *  All questions have been answered, and/or all requirements have been met.
